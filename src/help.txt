This is a level editor that sort of positions itself somewhere between Blender 
CAD and Unreal Editor. To goal is able to create geometry with precision,
and having the power of breaking away from level design constraints imposed
by traditional tooling.

Currently this tool is meant to fill out the missing features when using 
UED2, while maybe in the future it might become a more general tool with
additional use cases. We'll have to see how things turn out, I'm working on this
on my spare time so I heavily prioritize what features go in.


## Basic Usage

Select objects to edit them. Press `tab` to toggle between to edit the 3d model
of selected objects. This allows you to select vertexes and move them around.

Basic shortcuts are inspired from blender, so if you're familiar with those, 
good for you. `m` - move, `s` - scale, `r` - rotate, but instead of the tapping 
the letter and moving the mouse to make an edit, you need to specify edit points, 
for example each of these commands require an origin first. 

So to move a vertex you first click to set the origin, then click second time which
represents where you move the origin to. This will move all the selection in that direction.

Scaling and rotation require 3 points. This allows you to freely select rotation center
every time instead of having the rotation center always be the center of selection.

By default everything snaps. You can snap to vertexes, to edges, to the cetter of edges.

There is no save/open import/export. But you can copy paste level data, from/to 
text files and UED2.


## UV Mapping

Work in progress. 

Any viewport can be switched to UV mode, in UV mode the selected 3d model is shown 
in the UV space (currently view only, not editable)

But there is a partially working UV vertex preserve mode which can be toggled. 
When it is ON then every edit will maintain the vertex UV coordinates. Otherwise
the polygon UV is maintained. The first mode is useful for modeling organic shapes,
where the texture distorts. The second one is more useful for architecture where
making a wall longer will extend the wall texture instead of stretching it.

This can be toggled with `alt + u`, but the vertex UV preserve mode is only 
partially implemented for now.


## Command Palette

At any moment, press F1 to get a list of commands with short descriptions
and also their hotkeys. There are a few useful commands that are stable:

Align vertexes to 8x8x8/16x16x16/32x32x32 grid - will move each vertex to the 
nearest point on a 3D grid.

Triangulate Mesh Polygons - replaces all polygons with triangles.

Flip polygon - inverts polygon normal

UV: random polygon mapping - sets a random UV coordinates to each polygon, can useful to avoid 
having merged faces when exporting to UED2
